# sunspots
A sunspot number skill for mycroft. 

Yes, this duplicates a perfectly workable wolfram alpha query that already works, but it's a basis for future expansion. 

This skill pulls the current month's count CSV file from sidc.be, splits it, and responds with the count and the number of observatories.  For more information on the data, visit http://www.sidc.be/silso/datafiles and look at the Daily Estimated Sunspot Number.
